When a user types "google.com" in their browser and presses Enter, the following series of events typically occur:

DNS Request:

The browser makes a Domain Name System (DNS) request to convert the human-readable domain name "google.com" to an IP address.
The DNS server replies with the IP address for "google.com."

TCP/IP:

Following the IP address retrieval, the browser sets up a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connection with the server via IP. This is a layer of the TCP/IP protocol stack.

Firewall:

A request goes through firewalls, which are security mechanisms designed to monitor and regulate incoming and outgoing network traffic. The request is going to go to the next step once it passes the firewall checks.

HTTPS/SSL:

If the website is using HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure), the browser as well as the server establish a secure connection that is done through the SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security) protocols. It provides encryption from point to point between the userâ€™s browser and the server, safeguarding the data from possible eavesdropping or manipulation.

Load-Balancer:

Large sites such as Google might have load balancers set up. Load balancers distribute the incoming network traffic among several servers to maximize resource usage and avoid any server from becoming a bottleneck.

Web Server:

The request goes to one of Google's web servers. Web servers process the HTTP requests sent from the user's browser and return suitable responses

Application Server:

For dynamic content or more elaborate processing, the web server may communicate with an application server. This server executes the server-side script, runs applications, and interacts with databases to dynamically create content.

Database:

In case when the requested data is retrieved from the database, the application server will be in communication, in the event of storage, with a database. The database stores and retrieves the needed data to meet the user's demand.
