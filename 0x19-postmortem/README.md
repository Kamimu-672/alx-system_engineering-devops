Web Stack Debugging Project

Overview:

In the early hours of March 9, 2024, our web stack encountered a critical outage that impacted the core authentication service, disrupting user logins and access to protected resources. Lasting from 10:15 AM to 12:45 PM (UTC), this incident affected approximately 30% of our users, leading to login failures and delays.

Root Cause:

The root cause of the outage was traced back to an unexpected surge in database connections, resulting in connection pool exhaustion. This misconfiguration caused a cascade effect, rendering the authentication service unable to handle user requests efficiently.

Timeline:

10:15 AM:
Monitoring alerts signaled a significant increase in authentication service latency, prompting the engineering team's attention.

10:20 AM:
Initial investigations began to identify the root cause, with an initial assumption of a potential DDoS attack due to a sudden spike in traffic.

10:30 AM:
DDoS mitigation measures were initiated, but as they proved ineffective, focus shifted to the authentication service components.

11:00 AM:
Connection pool logs were analyzed to identify abnormal patterns, leading to the misleading assumption that recent code deployments might be the cause.

11:30 AM:
Unnecessary rollbacks based on the misleading assumption caused additional service disruptions, prompting the incident's escalation to the database team.

12:00 PM:
The database team identified the root cause - a misconfiguration in the database connection pool settings, causing an unexpected surge in open connections.

12:30 PM:
The misconfiguration was corrected, and the authentication service was gradually restored to normal operation.

12:45 PM:
With the correction implemented, the authentication service was fully restored, concluding the outage.

Root Cause and Resolution:

Root Cause:
An incorrect configuration in the database connection pool allowed an excessive number of connections to accumulate, leading to connection pool exhaustion.

Resolution:
The issue was resolved by adjusting the database connection pool settings, ensuring a more efficient and controlled handling of connection requests. A review of the configuration management process was initiated to prevent similar misconfigurations.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Things to Improve/Fix:

Configuration Management: Strengthen the process of reviewing and testing configuration changes to prevent misconfigurations causing service disruptions.

Monitoring Enhancement: Implement more granular monitoring for database connection pool metrics to proactively detect anomalies and potential issues.

Incident Response Training: Conduct training sessions to enhance the team's ability to identify and escalate issues accurately during incidents.

Tasks to Address the Issue:

Database Connection Pool Review: Thoroughly review all database connection pool settings to align with expected usage patterns.

Incident Response Drill: Schedule and execute an incident response drill to improve the team's efficiency in detecting and resolving similar issues.

Documentation Update: Update documentation related to authentication service and database configurations, emphasizing best practices to avoid misconfigurations.

This postmortem provides a comprehensive overview of the outage, its root cause, the timeline of events, and the corrective measures taken to prevent similar incidents in the future.
